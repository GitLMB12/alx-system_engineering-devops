# Regular Expression Project README

## Background Context

For this project, you will be utilizing Oniguruma, a regular expression library that is the default for Ruby. It's essential to note that different regular expression libraries may have different properties and behaviors.

The primary focus of this exercise is to work with regular expressions (regex). The provided Ruby code framework requires you to replace the regular expression pattern (regexp) to achieve the desired functionality.

## Instructions

To complete this project, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Objective**: First, make sure you understand the objective or the problem you're trying to solve using regular expressions.

2. **Review the Provided Ruby Code**: Take a look at the provided Ruby code. You'll notice a placeholder for the regular expression pattern (regexp) indicated by `//*:`. This is where you'll insert your regular expression.

3. **Build Your Regular Expression**: Using your knowledge of regular expressions and considering the problem at hand, construct a regular expression pattern that matches the desired text patterns.

4. **Replace the Regular Expression Placeholder**: Once you've built your regular expression, replace the placeholder `//*:` in the provided Ruby code with your regular expression.

5. **Test Your Solution**: Test your solution with different inputs to ensure that your regular expression behaves as expected and correctly matches the intended patterns.

6. **Refine and Iterate**: If necessary, refine your regular expression and repeat the testing process until you're satisfied with the results.

7. **Documentation**: Ensure your code is well-documented, providing comments where necessary to explain the purpose and functionality of your regular expression.

8. **Submission**: Once you're confident with your solution, submit your code along with any additional documentation as required.

## Additional Notes

- Take advantage of resources available online to learn more about regular expressions and their syntax.
- Experiment with different regular expression patterns and test them thoroughly to understand their behavior.
- Remember that regular expressions can be powerful tools but may also have limitations and edge cases to consider.
